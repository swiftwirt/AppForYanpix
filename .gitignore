# CocoaPods

# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control
#
# We modify the source of SlackTextViewController (See README.md) so its under SCM. (JL)
